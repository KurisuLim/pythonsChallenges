Challenges
1. Write a program that simulates a fortune cookie. The program
should display one of five unique fortune, at a random, each
time it's run.
2. Write a program that flips a coin 100 times and then tells you the
number of heads and tails.
3. Modify the Guess My Number game so that the player has a
limited number of guesses. If the player fails to guess in time,
the program should display an appropriately chastising
message.
4. Here's a bigger challenge. Write the pseudocode for a program
where the player and the computer trade places in the number
guessing game. That is, the player picks a random number
between 1 and 100 that the computer has to guess. Before you
start, think about how you guess. If all goes well, try coding the
game.
